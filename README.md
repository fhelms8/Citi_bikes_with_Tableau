When I started this project, I immedately noticed the amount of stations are not being used and/or have very limited amount of clientele. I began tearing apart the data, finding out what the top stations were, which stations had the greatest distance, etc. 
To my surprise, the busiest stations were not the stations that had the greatest distance. I wondered how we could optimize those stations, to bring in clientele and to utilize all the tools available.

Currently there is are 3 membership types that a customer can get
--------------------------------------------------
1) Single Pass - most for vistors/tourist. $3.50 for 30 mins + .18 per minute after. 
2) Day Pass- $15 per day + $4 for every 15 mins past 30 mins. 
3) Annual Membership- $15 monthly or $179 annual. 45 mins included + .12 centers per minute after

Potential issues with current passes
-----------------------------------------
1) Single Pass & Day pass: It becomes a hassel for a customer to have to return to any station within a 30 minute window. 
2) Annual Members that pay annually have only 15 extra minutes to ride around than a visitor. This does not encourage people to pay more with having the same hassel.

Potential Solution:
------------------
There are several stations that are not being utilized nearly as much as the others, which is causing the company to miss a lot of revenue and customers. 
I believe the way to solve this and to maximize profits is by adding different types of memberships that allow either visitors or members to use the bike for longer periods of time. 
For example:
1) Members with annual memberships should be able to take the bike out during the day, as long as they need it. You could gain so many members who are in need of a bike just to get to work or the grocery story and they could simply return it after their errands/tasks are completed for the day.
2) Add a package to rent out the bike for a full day without stopping at locations to check in/swap the bike. This is a major inconvience for the customers. 
3) If the customer is okay with checking in at other stations, I recommend creating routes to areas (popular and maybe add hidden gems that most tourist don't go see that only locals know about) that way they don't have to pay much, they are inclined to continue using the bike for the day and for longer periods of time, which would get more revenue and a better experience for both parties.
